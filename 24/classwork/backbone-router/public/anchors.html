  <p>Board of Education, and the inferior education they provided, then and now, helps explain the pervasive achievement gap between today's black and white students. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour in American life occurs on Sunday morning. He does not say education or the war. And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.

</p><p>But she had a healthy skepticism of religion as an institution. I wanted to be part of something larger. It's the wisdom Moses imparted to those who would succeed him. Despite the temptation to view my candidacy through a purely racial lens, we won commanding victories in states with some of the whitest populations in the country. At this moment, in this election, we must pledge once more to march into the future. Finally, I want to discuss economic development and opportunity.

</p><p>There is not a Black America and a White America and Latino America and Asian America - there's the United States of America. God is still speaking. And when one of his chief advisors - the man who wrote his economic plan - was talking about the anxiety Americans are feeling, he said that we were just suffering from a "mental recession," and that we've become, and I quote, "a nation of whiners." So long as our relationship is defined by our differences, we will empower those who sow hatred rather than peace, and who promote conflict rather than the cooperation that can help all of our people achieve justice and prosperity.

</p><p>And there's another issue we must confront as well. This time we want to talk about the fact that the real problem is not that someone who doesn't look like you might take your job; it's that the corporation you work for will ship it overseas for nothing more than a profit. And today, whenever I find myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility, what gives me the most hope is the next generation - the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to change have already made history in this election.

</p><p>That we can tuck in our children at night and know that they are fed and clothed and safe from harm. And God is still speaking. This time we want to talk about how the lines in the Emergency Room are filled with whites and blacks and Hispanics who do not have health care; who don't have the power on their own to overcome the special interests in Washington, but who can take them on if we do it together. She poured everything she had into me. And we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments - provided they govern with respect for all their people. For instance, in the United States, rules on charitable giving have made it harder for Muslims to fulfill their religious obligation.

</p><p>You know, a while back, I met a young man named Shamus [Seamus?] in a V.F.W. And it offends our conscience. They could've been told to succumb to the fear and frustration of so many dreams deferred. Around the world, the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-Semitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust.

</p><p>We are shaped by every culture, drawn from every end of the Earth, and dedicated to a simple concept: E pluribus unum: "Out of many, one." Hamas does have support among some Palestinians, but they also have responsibilities.

</p><p>That anger is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition, and prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. For we have a choice in this country. Now Ashley might have made a different choice. Not with so many children to educate, and so many veterans to care for. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not make true democracy.

</p><p>It's not consistent with our traditions of justice and fairness. We are more compassionate than a government that lets veterans sleep on our streets and families slide into poverty; that sits on its hands while a major American city drowns before our eyes.

</p><p>That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We will all have to make concessions to achieve this. And if we can do that - if we can embrace a common destiny - then I believe we'll not just help bring about a more hopeful day in America, we'll not just be caring for our own souls, we'll be doing God's work here on Earth. And I will restore our moral standing, so that America is once again that last, best hope for all who are called to the cause of freedom, who long for lives of peace, and who yearn for a better future. It is based upon cultural and historical ties, and the recognition that the aspiration for a Jewish homeland is rooted in a tragic history that cannot be denied.

</p><p>Thank you. And may God's peace be upon you.</p>
