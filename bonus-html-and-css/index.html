      Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to 
      <strong>my shirt with my name printed on it</strong>? 
      Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression 
      on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter 
      that shakes when you put quarters in it? No? Well, 
      that's what you see at a toy store. 
      And you must think you're in a toy store, 
      <div class="ib">
        because you're here shopping for an infant named Jeb
      </div>.
